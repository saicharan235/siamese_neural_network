# siamese_neural_network
 Face detection using  siamese neural network (One Shot Learning)
1) Main File (Jupyter Notebook) Contains all the data and other files are coded separately.
2) Siamese network is a model where it checks the similarity between two objects.
3) In these network we don't require 10000 images of one person and 1000 mages of other person.
4) Initially taking only some inputs and after training the models needs only one photo and it searches in our data base.
5) This is the use of siamese neural network.
6) Most of the companies like facebook and google uses this siamese network.
7) Here, in this project I built my own siamese network.
8) For face detection I used Media Pipe Library.
